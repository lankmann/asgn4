Our own implementation of GNU Tar, made by Sven Toernqvist and Riya Badadare

Compile instructions and tests:
make mytar: compiles all source files
make archive: tests create archive
make list: tests table of contents
make extract: tests extraction
make clean: removes leftover object and test files.

Usage:
Compile first: make mytar
To compress files
./mytar [vS]cf [tarfile] [ path [ ... ] ]
To list the files in an archive
./mytar [v]tf [tarfile]
To decompress an archive
./mytar [v]xf [tarfile]

The v option stands for verbose, meaning that the program will print extra information.
The S option means that the tar file is created in Strict accordance with GNU tar.
